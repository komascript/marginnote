This package provides the command `\marginnote` that may be used instead of
`\marginpar` at almost every place, where `\marginpar` cannot be used,
e.g. inside floats, footnotes, frames made with framed package â€¦

[Releases of marginnote are available from
CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/marginnote). You should install it using the
package manager of your TeX distribution. Updates should also be installed
using either MiKTeX upates or the TeX Live manager.
